# TODO

## Current "Sprint"
- Add hot reloading of the world when the rust changes



## Tower Defense Project

### Motivation:

I want to make this system more of a test bed for playing with webgl.
I think a good way to force that kind of abstraction is to build a game inside of here.

### Tasks

Make system more dev friendly:

- Make endless terrain gen optional
- Test different chunk sizing. Make load chunks and chunk sizing act more as expected

Make entities with logic

- Make a block that explodes

- One entity that stays in place and knows the entities around it
- One entity that moves around

Make fireball game on the engine
After fireball game publish to internet

- Add path finding algorithm

# 3d

We want to get this to be able to be loaded on my site for a "3D view"

- Support fonts
- Ability to open links
- Many more blocks
- Make a loading spinner for when the game is still loading chunks
- Convert whatever possible to workers
- Make a chunk holder class
- Fix biome smoothing
- Make trees spawn on ground

- Make hands visible in VR.
- Make vr two player
- Make shooting fireballs work
- Make fireballs break one block
- Move in 4 spacial dimensions

# Web Assembly

## Idea

NOTE FOR NEXT TIME

- I have to restart the dev server when the module is rebuilt
