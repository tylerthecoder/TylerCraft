Working out how update the chunk's visible faces. I think I will call is mesh now.

Seem to be a disconnect with how rust works and how I am trying to design this program.

Create 3 entities

Chunk

- Holds block info and performs basic get set operations.

ChunkMesh

- calculate all collision data
- Updates when chunk updates

World

- Stores overall structure of the blocks
- Shouldn't handle entities
- Keeps track of how to update meshes and chunks

Been playing with it more. Maybe there shouldn't be a Chunk Mesh at all. The world should just hold a giant map of world_positions to visible_faces?
